# Bullish Pin Bar Pro

This code is a sample implementation of a trading strategy that identifies and trades bullish pin bar patterns in the MetaTrader 5 platform. The strategy is designed to be used with the Forex Robot Easy's Bullish Pin Bar Pro product, which is a scalper app for forex trading.

## How it Works

The code uses the MQL5 programming language and relies on the Trade and PositionInfo libraries to interact with the MetaTrader 5 platform.

1. Constants are defined to set the criteria for identifying a bullish pin bar pattern, such as the body to tail ratio and trailing stop parameters.

2. Global variables are declared to store instances of the CTrade and CPositionInfo classes, which are used to execute trades and retrieve position information, respectively.

3. The `tradeBullishPinBar()` function is the core of the strategy. It retrieves the current candlestick data, calculates the body and tail lengths, and determines the body to tail ratio. If the current candlestick meets the criteria for a bullish pin bar pattern, a buy position is opened with appropriate entry, stop loss, and take profit levels. A trailing stop is also set for the position.

4. The `OnTick()` function serves as the entry point of the program. It checks if there is an open position using the `Total()` function of the `positionInfo` object. If there is no open position, the `tradeBullishPinBar()` function is called to identify and trade bullish pin bar patterns.
